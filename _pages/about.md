## NeoResearch community

NeoResearch is an open-source community focused in developing cutting-edge technologies for [NEO](https://neo.org/) blockchain.
NEO ecosystem comprises several projects from many development groups worldwide, including secure Wallets for users interacting with the blockchain, compilers for NeoVM in different programming languages and efficient consensus algorithms for blockchain management.

NeoResearch **is not a private company nor any form of legally constituted entity**, it's just a bunch of people crazy by blockchain technology and the Smart Economy revolution.


## Directions for contributing

Donations to the group are managed by [NeoResearch Council](https://github.com/NeoResearch/governance) members and can be distributed to contributors according to the following topics of interest (which are also aligned with [NEO Project](https://github.com/neo-project) directions):

- Development and contributions on platforms that provide **Integration** of NEO Ecosystem (integrations between different tools that increase overall user experience and simplify development on NEO);
- Development and contributions on platforms that provide greater **Stability** of NEO Ecosystem (bugfixes and validated/tested proposals for improvement of the main consensus project are also welcome);
- Conducted studies and assessment of state-of-the-art projects, including **Benchmarks** that could lead to platform improved **Efficiency** (projects that propose/test novel high performance tools/techniques also fit this topic);
- Standardization, creation and organization of [Learning Materials](https://github.com/NeoResearch/learning-examples), that could help newcomers to easily develop on NEO (tutorials, written and audiovideo materials, examples and coding templates, specially in different languages...).
